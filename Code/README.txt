Supplementary code package for the NAACL paper 'Toward Informal Language Processing: Knowledge of Slang in Large Language Models'. See the attached IPython notebook Eval-Slang.ipynb for an illustration of the contributed dataset and how it can be used to reproduce the main experiments in the paper. We include all code used to execute the experiments on BERT-like models (this includes BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) and illustrate example usage with BERT.
